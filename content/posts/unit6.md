# Unit 6
## Object pronouns
#### EXAMPLES
**subject pronoun > object pronoun (example)**  
I > me (Can you help **me**?)  
you > you (I love **you**.)  
he > him (She doesn't love **him.**)  
she > her (He phones **her** every day.)  
it > it (I don't like **it.**)  
we > us (Wait for **us!**)  
they > them (Please help **them.**)  

#### FORM
- Pronouns take the place of nouns.
- We use **subject** pronouns when the noun is the subject of the verb (i.e. the person who does the action).  
  _**John** is a doctor. **He** lives in London._
- We use object pronouns when the noun is the object of the verb (i.e. the person who receives the action).  
  _Anna knows **John.** She sees **him** every week._
- Object pronouns go after the verb.  
  _I **love you**._ **NOT** _I you love._

## Like + verb + -ing
#### EXAMPLES
\[++\] I **love shopping.**  
\[+\] I **like going** to the cinema.  
\[+/–\] I **don't mind getting** up early.  
\[–\] I **don't like doing** housework.  
\[––\] I **hate driving** at night.

#### FORM
- We use verb + _-ing_ after _like, love, don't mind and hate._
- We can also use verb + _-ing_ after _enjoy_ and _prefer._
