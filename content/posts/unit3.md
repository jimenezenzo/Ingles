# Unit 3

## Present simple \[+\] and \[â€“\]
#### EXAMPLES
I **speak** English.  
British people **like** gardens.  
My mother **cooks** fantastic food.  
I **don't drink** tea.  
We **don't live** in a house with a garden.  
He **doesn't play** the guitar.  

#### FORM
\[+\]  
I / you / we / you / they **work**  
he / she / it **works**  
\[-\]  
I / you / we / you / they **don't work**  
he / she / it **doesn't work**  
- We use the present simple for things that are generally true or are
habits.
- **Contractions:** _don't = do not, doesn't = does not_.
- To make negatives we _use don't / doesn't_ + verb (infinitive). _He doesn't **work**_. NOT _He doesn't works_.

## Present simple \[?\]
#### EXAMPLES
'**Do** you live in New York?' 'No, I **don't**.'  
'**Does** he work at night?' 'Yes, he **does**,'  

#### FORM
- We use do (or does with he, she, it) + infinitive to make questions.
- The word order for present simple questions is **ASI** = **A**uxiliary verb (do,does), **S**ubject (I, you, he, she, etc.), **I**nfinitive (work, live, etc.)

## Word order in questions
Questions with be

#### EXAMPLES
**Is** she from Spain?  
**Are** your friends here?  
What **is** your name?  
Where **is** your office?  
How many students **are** in the class?  
How **are** you?  
How old **is** she?  

#### FORM
- Remember the word order in questions with be. We put be before the subject.
