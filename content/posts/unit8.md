# Unit 8

## Past simple: regular and irregular
#### EXAMPLES
1. _**was / were**_ and **could**  
  \[+\] Gordon **was** Jeremy's business partner. They **were** at his country house.  
  They **could** hear a strange noise.  
  \[-\] She **wasn't** at home last night. You **weren't** very nice to her.  
  I **couldn't** sleep.  
  \[?\] **Were** you ill yesterday? When **was** he born? **Could** you see anybody in the library?
2. regular verbs  
  \[+\] I really **liked** the present. She **wanted** to be a doctor.  
  \[-\] She **didn't enjoy** the concert. They **didn't arrive** until very late.  
  \[?\] **Did** you **watch** the match last night? When **did** you **finish** the book?  
3. irregular verbs  
  \[+\] I **went** to Paris last summer. She slept on the sofa.  
  \[-\] He **didn't come** home last night. They **didn't hear** the music.  
  \[?\] **Did** you **speak** to your sister yesterday? Where **did** you **have** lunch?  

#### FORM
1. The past of _be_ is _was / were_, and the past of _can_ is _could._ We add _not_ to make negatives, and reverse the subject and verb to make questions.
2. Regular verbs add _-ed_ or _-d_ in the past simple \[+\]. e.g. _want–wanted, like–liked._
3. Irregular verbs change their form in the past simple \[+\], e.g. _go–went, see–saw._
    - Regular and irregular verbs (except be and can) use:  
    _didn't_ + infinitive to make negatives, e.g. _I didn't like it. She didn't see him._  
    _did_ + subject + infinitive to make questions, e.g. _Did you want to come? Where did she go?_

## There is / there are
#### EXAMPLES
**singular > plural**  
\[+\] **There's** a garage. > **There are** some pictures on the wall.  
\[-\] **There isn't** a swimming pool. > **There aren't** any plant in the room.  
\[?\] **Is there** a bathroom downstairs? > **Are there** any neighbours with children?  
\[✓\] Yes, **there is.** > Yes, **there are.**  
\[✗\] No, there **isn’t.** > No, **there aren't.**

#### FORM
**there is / there are**  
• We use _there is / there are_ to say that something exists or doesn't exist, e.g. _There's a bathroom upstairs. There isn't a bathroom downstairs._  
• We use _there is_ + a singular noun and _there are_ + plural nouns.  
• _There is_ is often contracted to _There's. There are_ is not usually contracted.  
• When we talk about a list of things, we use _there is_ if the first thing in the list is singular and _there are_ if the first thing in the list is plural.  
_In my bedroom **there's** a bed, two chairs, and a desk._  
_In the living room **there are** two armchairs and a sofa._

### Some / any + plural nouns
_**a / an, some and any**_
- We often use _there is / isn't_ with _a / an_, and _there are / there aren't_ with _some_ and _any._
- We use some and any with plural nouns. Some = not an exact number, e.g. _There are some eggs in the fridge._
- We use _some_ in  \[+\] sentences, and _any_ in \[–\] and \[?\]. 

## There was / there were
#### EXAMPLES
**singular > plural**  
\[+\] **There was** a big mirror. > **There were** four lamps.  
\[-\] **There wasn't** a TV. > **There weren't** any ghosts.  
\[?\] **Was there** a bathroom? > **Were there** any windows?  
\[✓\] Yes, **there was.** > Yes, **there were.**  
\[✗\] No, **there wasn't.** > No, **there weren't.**

#### FORM
- _there was / there were_ is the past of _there is / there are._ We use _there was / there were_ to say that something existed or didn't exist, e.g. _There were two computers in the office, but there wasn't a printer._
