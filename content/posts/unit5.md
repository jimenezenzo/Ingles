# Unit 5

## Can / can't
#### EXAMPLES
1. **I can** sing, but **I can't** dance.
2. **I can** come on Tuesday, but **I can't** come on Wednesday.
3. **You can** park here. **You can't** park there.
4. **Can you** help me? **Can I** open the window?

#### FORM
- can + infinitive has different meanings:
   1. _I can (sing)_ = I know how to.  
   _I can't (dance)_ = I don't know how to.
   2. _I can (come)_ = It's possible for me.  
   _I can't (come)_ = It isn't possible for me.
   3. _You can (park here)_ = It's OK. / It's permitted.  
   _You can't (park there)_ = It isn't OK. / It isn't permitted.
   4. _Can you (help me)?_ = Please do it.  
   _Can I (open the window)?_ = Is it OK if I do it?
- can and can't are the same for all persons (I, you, he, etc.).  
  **NOT** He cans.
- **Contraction:** can't = cannot.
- We don't use to after can.  
  **_I can swim._ NOT** _I can to swim._

## Present continuous
#### EXAMPLES
**They're having** a party next door.  
Oh no! **The baby's crying.**  
**It's raining.**   
**A** What **are you doing**?  
**B I'm waiting** for my brother.  

#### FORM
\[+\]  
I[**'m having**] a party.  
You / We / They[**'re having**] a party.  
He / She / It[**'s having**] a party.  
\[â€“\]  
I[**'m not having**] a party.  
You / We / They **aren't having** a party.  
He / She / It **isn't having** a party.  
- We use the present continuous for things that are happening now / at the moment.
- At _the moment_ can mean _around now._  
  I[**'m reading**] a good book at the moment. (= not exactly now).
- We also use the present continuous with longer periods of time,
e.g. _today, this week, this month._ The present continuous emphasizes
that the action is **temporary**, not a habit.  
  I[**'m working**] at home **this week** because my daughter isn't very well.

Spelling rules for -ing forms  
**infinitive > verb + -ing (spelling)**  
cook > cook**ing** (+ -ing)  
danc**e** > danc**ing** (no e + -ing)  
swi**m** > swim**ming** (word ending with one vowel + one consonant = double
consonant + -ing)

## Present simple or present continuous?
#### EXAMPLES
**present simple > present continuous**  
It always **snows** here in winter. > Look! It[**'s snowing!**]  
What **do you** usually **do** at work? > What **are you doing** now?  
My sister **works** in a bank. > Today she[**'s working**] at home.  

#### FORM
- We use the **present simple** to say what we usually do, or things that
are normally true.
- We ofte use the **present simple** with adverbs and expressions of
frequency, e.g. _always, often, once a week,_ etc.
- We use the **present continuous** to say what is happening now or
around now.
- We often use the **present continuous** with _at the moment, today, this week._
