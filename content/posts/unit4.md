# Unit 4

## Possessive 's, Whose ...?
#### EXAMPLES
1. He's Brad Pitt[**'s**] brother. It's James[**'s**] laptop.
2. It's my parent[**s'**] car.
3. '**Whose** is this bag?' 'It's Maria[**'s**]'.

#### FORM
1. We use a person + 's to talk about family and possessions.  
  _He's Brad Pitt[**'s**] brother._ **NOT** _He's the brother of Brad Pitt._
2. With regular plural nouns we put the ' after the s.  
  _It's my parent[**s'**] car._ **NOT** _It's my parent's car._
    - With irregular plural nouns, e.g. children, men, we use 's, e.g. _the children's room, men's clothes._
3. We use Whose ...? to ask about possession.  
  We can ask Whose is this bag? **OR** Whose bag is this?  
  We can answer It's Maria's bag. **OR** It's Maria's.
4. We don't usually use a thing + 's, e.g. _the end of the class_ **NOT** _the class's end, the city centre_ **NOT** _the city's centre._

## Position of adverbs, expressions of frequency
#### EXAMPLES

Do you **usually** sleep eight hours a day?  
She **sometimes** does sport.  
She doesn't **often** go to bed late.
2. They're **hardly ever** late.  
He isn't **often** stressed.  
Are you **usually** in this classroom?
3. I have English classes **twice a week**.  
She doesn't work **every day**.

#### FORM
1. We use adverbs and expressions of frequency to say how often you do
something.  
_'How often do you cook?' 'I cook every evening.'_  
    - Adverbs of frequency go before the main verb.
    - In negative sentences, the adverb of frequency goes between don't /
doesn't and the verb.
2. Adverbs of frequency go after be in \[+\] and \[â€“\] sentences. In \[?\] with be the
adverb goes after the subject.
    - We use a \[+\] verb with hardly ever and never.  
    _He's **never** stressed._ **NOT** _He isn't never stressed._
3. Expressions of frequency usually go at the end of a sentence or verb
phrase.
