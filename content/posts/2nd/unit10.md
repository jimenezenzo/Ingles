# Unit 10

## Superlative adjectives
#### EXAMPLES
It's **the oldest** bridge in the world.  
It's **the most popular** shopping street in Europe.  
She's **the best** student in the class.  
Monday is **the worst** day of the week.  

#### FORM
- We use _the_ + superlative adjective to say which is the (_biggest,_ etc.) in a group.
- After superlatives we use _in_ (not _of_) + places, e.g. _the longest road in the world, the tallest building in New York._

#### SPELLING RULES
- one syllable adjectives: + _-est_ or _-st_, e.g. _old → **the** old**est**, nice → **the** nice**st**._
- adjectives ending in one vowel + one consonant: double consonant + _-est,_ e.g. _big → **the** big**gest**, hot → **the** hot**test**._
- one- or two-syllable adjectives ending in consonant + _y:_ change _y_ to _i_ + _-est,_ e.g. _dry → **the** dr**iest**, healthy → **the** health**iest**._
- one-syllable adjectives ending in _-ed: the most_ + adjective, e.g. _bored → **the most** bored, stressed → **the most** stressed._
- two- or more-syllable adjectives: _the most_ + adjective, e.g. _famous → **the most** famous, expensive → **the most** expensive._
- irregular: _good → **the best**; bad → **the worst**; far → **the furthest**._

## Be going to (plans), future time expressions
#### EXAMPLES
I[**'m going to have**] a holiday next month.  
I[**'m not going to study**] English.  
**Are** you **going to fly** to Paris?

#### FORM
- We use _be going to_ + verb (infinitive) to talk about future plans.
- We often use future time expressions with _be going to_, e.g. _tomorrow, next week, next month, next year,_ etc.

## Be going to (predictions)
#### EXAMPLES
I think it[**'s going to rain.**]  
You[**'re going to be**] very happy.  
I'm sure they[**'re going to win.**]

### FORM
