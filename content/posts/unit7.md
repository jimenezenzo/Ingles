# Unit 7
## Past simple of be: was / were
#### EXAMPLES
Vincent can Gogh **was** an artist.  
**Was** he Dutch or French?  
She **wasn't** in class yesterday.  
The Beatles **were** famous in the 1960s.  
Where **were** you last night? You **weren't** at home.

#### FORM
- We use _was / were_ to talk about the past.
- We often use _was / were_ with past time expressions, e.g. _yesterday, last night, in 2014,_ etc.
- We use _was / were_ with born.  
  _I **was born** in Scotland._

## Past simple: regular verbs
#### EXAMPLES
1. I **booked** the flights yesterday.  
  We **arrived** at the airport at 10.00 this morning.
2. When I was young, I **watched** TV every night.  
  I **worked** as a waiter every weekend when I was at university.

#### FORM
- We use the past simple for:  
    1. finished actions that happened once in the past.
    2. finished actions that happened more than once in the past.
- **Contraction:** _didn't = did not._
- Regular verbs in the past simple \[+\] end in _-ed,_ e.g. _worked, lived, played._
- The past simple is the same for all persons _(I, you, she, etc.)._
- We use _did / didn't_ + infinitive for past simple \[?\] and \[–\]. _Did_ is the past of _do._

## Past simple: irregular verbs
#### EXAMPLES
I **went** to Iceland in December. I **didn't go** to New York.  
**Did** you **go** to a party? Who **did** you **go** with?

#### FORM
- Some verbs are irregular in the past \[+\] and change their form, e.g. _go → went, have → had._
- We only use the irregular past form in \[+\] sentences.  
  _I **bought** a bag last night._
- We use the infinitive after _did / didn't._  
  _**Did** you **go** out last night?_ **NOT** _Did you went ...?_
- Remember word order in questions: **ASI** (**A**uxiliary, **S**ubject, **I**nfinitive), e.g. _Did you go shopping yesterday?_ **QUASI** (**Qu**estion word, **A**uxiliary, **S**ubject, **I**nfinitive), e.g. _Where did you go?_
