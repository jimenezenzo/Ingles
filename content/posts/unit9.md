# Unit 9

## Countable / uncountable nouns
#### EXAMPLES
**Countable**  
an apple, three apples  
**Uncountable**  
rice, meat  

#### FORM
- English nouns can be **countable** and **uncountable.**  
countable = things you can count, e.g. _apples._ Countable nouns can be singular _(an apple)_ or plural _(apples)._  
uncountable = things you can't count, e.g. _rice, meat_ **NOT** _two rices, three meats._ Uncountable nouns are usually singular.
- Some nouns can be countable and uncountable, e.g. _ice cream._  
_an ice cream_ = one ice cream in your hand  
_some ice cream_ = ice cream in a bowl

## Quantifiers
#### EXAMPLES
**uncountable (singular)**  
**How much** sugar do you eat?  

**short answers / full answers**  
**A lot.** / I eat **a lot of** sugar.  
**Quite a lot.** / I eat **quite a lot of** sugar.  
**A little.** / I eat **a little** sugar.  
**Not much.** / I **don’t** eat **much** sugar.

**A few.** / I eat **a few** sweets.  
**Not many.** / I **don’t** eat **many** sweets.  
**None.** / I **don’t** eat **any** sweets

#### FORM
- We use _How much…?_ with uncountable nouns and _How many…?_ with plural countable nouns.
- We use:  
_a lot (of)_ with countable and uncountable nouns for a **big quantity.**  
_quite a lot (of)_ for a **medium quantity.**  
_a little / not…much_ with uncountable nouns for a **small quantity.**  
_a few / not…many_ with countable plural nouns for a **small quantity.**  
_not…any_ (none in short answers) for **zero quantity.**  
_**a lot of and much / many**_
    - In \[+\] sentences we usually use _a lot of._
    - In \[+\] sentences and \[?\] we usually use _much_ and _many._  
    _I don’t drink **much** water. Do you drink **much** coffee?_
    - It is also possible to use _a lot of_ in \[+\] and \[?\].  
    _I don’t eat **a lot of** vegetables. Do you drink **a lot of** coffee?_

## Comparative adjectives
#### EXAMPLES

Canada is **bigger than** the USA.  
K2 is **more difficult** to climb **than** Mount Everest.  
My new job is **better than** my old one.  
The traffic is always **worse** in the evening.

#### FORM
We use comparative adjectives + _than_ to compare two things, people, etc.

#### SPELLING RULES
- one syllable adjectives: + _-er or -r, e.g. old → old**er**, nice → nice**r**._
- adjectives ending in one vowel + one consonant: double consonant + _-er, e.g. big → big**ger**, hot → hot**ter**._
- one- or two-syllable adjectives ending in consonant + _y:_ change _y_ to _i + -er, e.g. dry → dr**ier**, healthy → health**ier**._
- one-syllable adjectives ending in _-ed: more_ + adjective, e.g. _tired → **more** tired, bored → **more** bored._
- two- or more-syllable adjectives: _more_ + adjective, e.g. _famous → **more** famous, expensive → **more** expensive._
- irregular: _good → **better**; bad → **worse**; far → **further**._
