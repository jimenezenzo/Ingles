# Unit 2

## Past simple: regular and irregular verbs

#### EXAMPLES

**Regular**  
\[+\] We **stayed** at a hotel last summer.  
\[–\] He **didn't stay** with friends.  
\[?\] **Did** you **stay** for the weekend?  
\[✓\] / \[✗\] Yes, I **did**. / No I **didn't**.  
Wh \[?\] Where did **you stay**?  

**Irregular**  
\[+\] I **went** to Turkey twice last year.  
\[–\] She **didn't go** to France.  
\[?\] **Did** you go to Madrid?  
\[✓\] / \[✗\] Yes, I **did**. / No I **didn't**.  
Wh \[?\] Why **did** you **go**?

#### FORM
- We use the past simple to talk about finished actions that happened once or more than once in the past.
- The form for the past simple is the same for all persons.
- To make the past simple \[+\] of regular verbs add -ed. See the spelling rules in the chart.
- Many verbs are irregular in past simple \[+\], e.g. _go → **went**, see → **saw**_.
- We use didn't + infinitive for negatives and Did... + subject + infinitive for questions.
- Use **ASI** and **QuASI** to remember word order in questions.

### SPELLING RULES
work → work**ed**, stay → stay**ed**   add -ed  
like → like**d**   add -d if verb finishes in e  
study → stud**ied**   y  → ied after a consonant  
stop → stop**ped**   if verb finishes in consonant-vowel-consonant, double the final consonant

## Past continuous: was / were + verb + -ing

#### EXAMPLES
At 8.45 last Saturday I **was walking** in the park.  
The birds **were singing**. 
It **wasn't raining**.  
**Was** it **raining** when you got up? No, it **wasn't**.   
What **were** you **doing** at 11 o'clock last night? I **was watching** TV.   

#### FORM
\[+\]  
I / He / She / It **was working**.  
You / We / They **were working**.  
\[–\]  
I / He / She / It **wasn’t working**.  
You / We / They **weren’t working**.  
\[?\] \[✓\] / \[✗\]  
**Was** he **working**? Yes, he **was**. / No, he **wasn’t**.  
**Were** they **working**? Yes, they **were**. / No, **they weren’t**.  

- We use the past continuous to describe an action in progress at a specific time in the past.
- We often use the past continuous to describe the situation at the beginning of a story, e.g. _In 1972 I was living in London_.

## Time sequencers

#### EXAMPLES
On their first date they went to a restaurant. **After that** they started meeting every day.  
On Thursday I had an argument with my boss. **The next day** I decided to look for a new job.  
We sat down to eat. **Two minutes later** my phone rang.  
**When** I came out of the club, he was waiting for me.  
The accident happened **when** I was crossing the road.

#### FORM
- We use time sequencers to say when or in what order things happen.  
- We use when as a time sequencer and also to join two actions. I **was watching** TV when the phone **rang**. (two verbs joined by when)
