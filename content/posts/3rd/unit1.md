# Unit 1

## Word order in questions

### Questions with be and can

#### EXAMPLES  
**Are** you hungry?  
**Is** there a bank near here?  
**Can** I sit here?  
What **was** that noise?  
Where **were** you born?

#### FORM  
- We make questions with the verb be and can by inverting the verb and the subject.  
**She is** a teacher. → **Is she** a teacher?  
**He can** drive. → **Can he** drive?  

### Questions with do / does / did in present simple and past simple

#### EXAMPLES  
**Do** you **live** with your parents?  
**Did** you **have** a holiday last year?  
Where **does** your sister **work**?  
When **did** you **start** studying English?  
What **did** they **talk** about?  

#### FORM  
- You can use **ASI** (**A**uxiliary, **S**ubject, **I**nfinitive) or **QUASI** (**Q**uestion word, **A**uxiliary, **S**ubject, 
**I**nfinitive) to remember word order in questions. If there's a preposition, we often put it at the end of the question, 
e.g. _Who do you live with_?  

## Present simple

#### EXAMPLES
**_I / you / we / they_**                 
\[+\]  I usually **work** at home.   
\[–\]  My parents **don't live** near here.  
\[?\]  **Do** you **speak** French?  
\[✓\]  Yes, I **do**. \[✗\] No, I **don't**.  

**_he / she / it_**  
\[+\]  My brother **works** in the city centre.  
\[–\]  It **doesn't** often **rain** here.  
\[?\]  **Does** he **like** pop music?  
\[✓\]  Yes, he **does**. \[✗\] No, he **doesn't**.  

#### FORM
We use the present simple for things we do every day / week / year, or which are generally true or always happen.  
We use don’t / doesn’t in negative sentences, and do / does in questions.  

#### SPELLING RULES
work   work**s**   add -s  
study   stud**ies**   consonant + y ➞ ies  
finish   finish**es**   add -es after ch, s, sh, x  
go / do   go**es** / do**es**   add -es  
have   ha**s**   change to -s  

## Adverbs and expressions of frequency

#### EXAMPLES
1. We **often** go out on Friday night.  
  She doesn't **usually** study at weekends.  
  I'm **never** ill.  
  He's **always** late for work.  

2. She gets up early **every day.**  
  We have English classes **twice a week.**  

#### FORM
1. We often use the present simple with adverbs of frequency (_always, often, sometimes, usually, hardly ever, never_). 
    - Adverbs of frequency go **before** the main verb. 
    - Adverbs of frequency go **after** be. She’s never ill. **NOT** She’s ill never. 
    - Remember to use a \[+\] verb with never. It never rains. **NOT** It doesn’t never rain. 
2. Expressions of frequency (_every day, once a week, etc._) usually go at the end of a sentence.  

## Present continuous: be + verb + -ing

#### EXAMPLES
1. **A** What **are you doing**?  
  **B I'm sending** a message to Sarah.  
2. My brother **is doing** a two-month course in the UK.  
3. In this picture the woman **is standing** near a table.  

#### FORM
- We use the present continuous:  
  1. for things happening now, at this moment.  
  2. for temporary things that are happening around now, this week, etc.  
  3. to describe what's happening in a picture.  

\[+\]  
I **’m working**  
you / we / they **’re working**   
he / she / it **’s working**  

\[–\]  
I **’m not working**  
you / we / they **aren’t working**  
he / she / it **isn’t working**  

\[?\] \[✓\] / \[✗\]  
**Are** you **working**? **Yes**, I **am**. / **No**, I **’m not**.  
**Is** he **working**? **Yes**, he **is**. / **No**, he **isn’t**.  

#### SPELLING RULES
cook → cook**ing**, study → study**ing** add _-ing_  
live → liv**ing** cut the final _e_ and add _-ing_  
run → runn**ing** if verb finishes in consonant-vowel-consonant, double the final consonant and add _-ing_.
