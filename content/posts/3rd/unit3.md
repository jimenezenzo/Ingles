# Unit 3

## Be going to (plans and predictions)

#### EXAMPLES
1. I **'m going to give** a talk at the conference.  
   He **'s going to meet** me at the airport.  
2. I'm sure England **are going to lose** tomorrow.  
   It **'s going to rain** tonight.  

#### FORM
**I**  
\[+\] I **'m going to give** a talk.  
\[–\] I **'m not going to give** a talk.  
**You / We / They**  
\[+\] You / We / They **'re going to give** a talk.  
\[–\] You / We / They **aren't going to give** a talk.  
**He / She / It**  
\[+\] He / She / It **'s going to give** a talk.  
\[–\] He / She / It **isn't going to give** a talk.  


\[?\] **Are** you **going to** give a talk ?  
\[+\] **Yes**, I **am**. \[–\] **No**, I **'m not**.  
\[?\] **Is** he **going to** give a talk ?  
\[+\] **Yes**, he **is**. \[–\] **No**, he **isn't**.  

- We use be going to + infinitive to talk about future plans or intentions.  
- We also use be going to + infinitive to make a prediction when we know or can see that something is going to happen, e.g.  
    _It's winter there, so it **'s going to be** cold._  
    _Look at that car! It **'s going to crash**._

## Present continuous (future arrangements)

#### EXAMPLES
\[+\]  
I **'m seeing** a friend tonight.  
She **'s arriving** at lunchtime.  
\[–\]  
She **isn't leaving** until Friday.  
They **aren't coming** to the party.  
\[?\]  
What **are** you **doing** this evening?  
**Is** she **meeting** us at the restaurant?

#### FORM
We often use the present continuous with a future meaning, especially for future arrangements, i.e. for plans 
we have made for a fixed time and place in the future. Don't use the present simple for this. 
**NOT** _I see some friends tonight._  

## Defining relative clauses with who, which, where

#### EXAMPLES
1.  That's the woman **who** won the lottery last year.  
    A chef is a person **who** cooks food in a restaurant.
2.  A clock is something **which** tells the time.  
    Is that the book **which** won an important prize?
3.  A post office is a place **where** you can buy stamps.  
    That's the restaurant **where** I had dinner last week.

#### FORM
- We use defining relative clauses to explain what a person, thing or place is or does.
   1.  Use _who_ for a person.
   2.  Use _which_ for a thing.
   3.  Use _where_ for a place.
- The verb after where needs a subject, e.g. _you._
- We can also use which to talk about a place, e.g.  
    _A post office is a place which sells stamps._
