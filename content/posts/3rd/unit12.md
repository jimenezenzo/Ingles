# Unit 12

## Past perfect

#### EXAMPLES 
\[+\] When I woke up, the garden was all white. It **had snowed** during the night.  
    I suddenly realized that I<strong>'d left</strong> my phone in the taxi.  
\[–\] We got home just in time – the match **hadn't started.**  
    When she got to class, she realized that she **hadn't brought** her book.  
\[?\] A I went to Paris last weekend. I really loved it.  
    B **Had** you **been** there before?  
    A No, I **hadn't.**

#### FORM
- We use the past perfect when we are already talking about the past and want to talk about an earlier past action.
- _When I woke up, the garden was all white. It **had snowed** during the night._ = It snowed before I woke up.
- We make the past perfect with _had / hadn't_ + the past participle.
- The form of the past perfect is the same for all persons.
- _had_ is sometimes contracted to _'d._

## Reported (or indirect) speech

#### EXAMPLES

##### Direct speech > reported speech
'**I love you.'** > He said (that) **he loved me.**  
'**I've just arrived.'** > She said (that) **she had just arrived.**  
**We'll come at eight.'** > He told me (that) **they would come at eight.**  
'**I don't want** to go to the party.' > Jack told Anna (that) **he didn't want** to go to the party.

#### FORM
- We use reported speech to tell somebody what another person said.
- We often introduce reported speech with _said_ or _told_ (+ person).
- After _said_ or _told_, that is optional,  
e.g. _He said (that) he loved me._
- Pronouns often change in reported speech,  
e.g. _I_ changes to _he_ or _she_.
'I'm tired.' _**She** told me (that) **she** was tired._        
- Verb tenses change like this:  
'I **can** help you.' (present simple) > He said (that) he **could** help me. (past simple)  
'I<strong>'m driving.</strong>' (present continuous) > 'She said (that) she **was driving**. (past continuous)  
'I<strong>'ll</strong> call you.' (will) > He told me (that) he **would** call me. (would)  
'I **met** a girl at a party.' (past simple) > John told me (that) he **had met** a girl at a party. (past perfect)  
'I<strong>'ve broken</strong> my arm.' (present perfect) > Sara said (that) she **had broken** her arm. (past perfect)
