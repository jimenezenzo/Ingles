# Unit 6

## Will / won't (predictions)

    The film's in French. We **won't understand** anything.
2.  It's a great book. I'm sure you<strong>'ll likee</strong> it.  
    I don't think it<strong>'ll raine</strong> tomorrow.

#### FORM
Contractions: _'ll = will; won't = will not_  
1. We often use _will / won't_ for future predictions, i.e. to say things we think, guess or know about the future.
2. We often use _I think / I don't think / I'm sure_ with will.  
_I **think** he<strong>'ll fail</strong> the exam._
_I **don't think** he<strong>'ll pass. NOT</strong> I think he won't pass._

- We use _will / won't_ for all persons, e.g.  
_I<strong>'ll be</strong> late. I **won't be** late._  
_**Will** you **be** late? **Yes**, I **will**. / **No**, I **won't**._

## Will / won't / shall (other uses)

#### EXAMPLES
**Decisions**  
I **won't stay** for dinner. I think I<strong>'ll go</strong> home early.

**Offers**  
I<strong>'ll help</strong> you with your homework. **Shall** I **open** the window?

**Promises**  
I<strong>'ll</strong> always **love** you. I **won't tell** anybody.

#### FORM
- We use _will / won't_ + infinitive for making instant decisions, offers, and promises.  
  We don't use the present tense.  
  _I<strong>'ll help</strong> you with those bags. **NOT** I help you with those bags._
- When an offer is a question, we use _Shall I ...? or Shall we ...?_  
  _**Shall I** pay? **Shall we** do the washing-up?_
