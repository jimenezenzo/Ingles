# Unit 9

## Present perfect + for and since

#### EXAMPLES
A Where do you live now?  
B In Manchester.  
A **How long have** you **lived** there?  
B I<strong>'ve lived</strong> there **for** 20 years.  
<br/>
A Where do you work?  
B In a primary school.  
A **How long have** you **worked** there?  
B I<strong>'ve worked</strong> there **since** 2015.  

#### FORM
- We use the present perfect with _for_ and _since_ with actions and states that started in the past and are still true now.  
_I<strong>'ve lived</strong> in Manchester for twenty years._ = I came to live in Manchester twenty years ago, and I live in Manchester now.  
We don't use the present simple in this type of sentence, e.g. **NOT** _I live in Manchester for twenty years._  
- We use _How long ...?_ to ask about the duration of an action or a state, e.g. _How long have you been married?_

### For or since

- We use for + a period of time, e.g. _**for** two weeks, **for** ten years,_ etc.  
_I've had this car **for** three months._
- We use since with the beginning of a period of time, e.g. _**since** 2014, **since** last June,_ etc.  
_I've been afraid of spiders **since** I was a child._
