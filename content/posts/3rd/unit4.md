# Unit 4

## Present perfect

#### EXAMPLES
1.  I<strong>'ve cleaned</strong> the fridge – it looks new!  
    He **hasn't done** the washing up. Can you help me do it?  
    A The concert starts soon. **Have** you **turned off** your phone?  
    B Yes, **I have.**
2.  Mary<strong>'s had</strong> her baby!  
    A parcel **has arrived** for you.

#### FORM
1.  We often use the present perfect to talk about the recent past and its relationship with the present, e.g. _I've cleaned the fridge, so now it looks new._  
We don't say exactly when things happened, e.g. _I've cleaned the fridge._ **NOT** _I've cleaned the fridge ten minutes ago._
2.  We often use the present perfect to give recent news.

**Full form**  
I / you / we / they **have finished** the washing up.  
He / she / it / **has finished** the washing up.

**Contraction**  
I<strong>'ve</strong> / you<strong>'ve</strong> / we<strong>'ve</strong> / they<strong>'ve</strong> **finished** the washing up.  
He<strong>'s</strong> / she<strong>'s</strong> / it<strong>'s</strong> **finished** the washing up. 

**Negative**  
I / you / we / they **haven't finished** the washing up.   
He / she / it **hasn't finished** the washing up.   

**Question and short answers**  
**Have** I / you / we / they **finished** the exercise?   
Yes, I / you / we / they **have**. No, I / you / we / they **haven't**.  
**Has** he / she / it **done** the homework?   
Yes, he / she / it **has**. No, he / she / it **hasn't**.  

-   For regular verbs, the past participle is the same as the past simple (+ –ed). For irregular verbs, the past participle
 is sometimes the same as the past simple (e.g. _buy, bought, bought_) and sometimes different (e.g. _do, did, done_).

## Present perfect: experiences and unfinished time

#### EXAMPLES
She<strong>'s been</strong> to New York three times.  
**Have** you **ever been** to Ikea?  
I<strong>'ve never met</strong> Nina's husband.  
He<strong>'s seen</strong> that film twice.

#### FORM
We often use the present perfect to talk about past experiences or to talk about the recent past when we don't specify a time. 
In questions and negatives we often use _ever_ (=at any time in your life) and _never._

## Present perfect or past simple

#### EXAMPLES
A **Have you ever been** to Mexico?  
B Yes, **I have.**  
A When **did** you **go** there?   
B I **went** last year.

A Jack<strong>'s broken</strong> his leg!   
B Oh no! When **did** that **happen**?  
A Yesterday. He **broke** it playing football.

#### FORM
-   Conversations about experiences or the recent past often begin in the present perfect (with a general question or some news) and
    then change to the past simple to ask for or give specific details, e.g. _when, what, where, who with_, etc.

## Something, anything, nothing, etc.

#### EXAMPLES
**People**  
\[+\] **Somebody** / **Someone** has taken my pen!  
\[–\] I didn't speak to **anybody** / **anyone** all weekend.  
\[?\] Did **anybody** / **anyone** phone?  
\[X\] No, **nobody** / **no one. Nobody** / **No one** phoned.

**Things**  
\[+\] I bought **something** for dinner.  
\[–\] I didn't do **anything** at the weekend.  
\[?\] Is there **anything** in the fridge?  
\[X\] No, **nothing**. There's **nothing** in the fridge.

**Places**  
\[+\] Let's go **somewhere** this weekend.  
\[–\] We didn't go **anywhere** this summer.  
\[?\] Is there **anywhere** to park?  
\[X\] No, **nowhere**. There's nowhere to park.

FORM
- We use _somebody / someone, something, somewhere_, etc. with a \[+\] verb when you don't say exactly who, what or where.
- We use _anybody / anyone, anything, anywhere_, etc. in questions and negatives. We can also use something in a request or 
offer, e.g. _Can you buy something for dinner tonight? Would you like something to drink?_  
_I **didn't** do **anything** last night._ **NOT** _I didn't do nothing last night._
- We use _nobody / no one, nothing, nowhere_ in short answers or in a sentence with a \[+\] verb.
